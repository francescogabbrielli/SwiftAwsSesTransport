# SwiftAwsSesTransport
Swift Mailer Transport for using AWS SES Php Api v3

## What is it?
An updated version of the transport using AWS SesClient

## Where do I put it?
The best way to use it is through [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

    $ composer require francescogabbrielli/swiftmailer-aws-ses-transport

Which will bring in Swiftmailer if you don't already have it installed.

Otherwise Swift can autoload it if you put the files in this directory:

    [swift library root]/classes/Swift
